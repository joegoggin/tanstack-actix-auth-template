/**
 * Storybook decorator for in-memory routing during interaction tests.
 *
 * Covered behavior:
 * - Mounts stories at configurable `storyPath`.
 * - Supports configurable `initialEntries` for navigation/redirect assertions.
 * - Provides route stubs for all auth/dashboard paths used by page stories.
